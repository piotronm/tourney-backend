- Test Files: 2 files (both with some failures)

#### E2E Test Failures (10 tests):

**e2e.seed.spec.ts (9 failures):**
1. ❌ POST /api/divisions/:id/seed - "should seed a tournament with even teams successfully"
   - Expected: 200, Got: 500

2. ❌ POST /api/divisions/:id/seed-dupr - "should generate teams from players successfully"
   - Expected: 200, Got: 500

3. ❌ POST /api/divisions/:id/seed-dupr - "should create balanced team pairings"
   - Expected players array length: 2, Got: 0

4. ❌ POST /api/divisions/:id/seed-dupr - "should support snake-draft strategy"
   - Expected: 200, Got: 500

5. ❌ POST /api/divisions/:id/seed-dupr - "should generate correct team names from player last names"
   - Expected teams array length: 1, Got: 0

9. ❌ POST /api/divisions/:id/seed-dupr Court scheduling - "should schedule matches to courts when enabled"
   - Expected: 200, Got: 500

**e2e.export.spec.ts (1 failure):**
10. ❌ GET /api/divisions/:id/export.csv - "should include correct match numbers and rounds"
    - Expected: 200, Got: 500

#### E2E Analysis:
- **Root Cause**: Most failures appear to be actual application bugs, not environment issues
- Database schema is correct (verified via sqlite3)
- better-sqlite3 IS working (this was the Windows blocker!)
- Errors suggest issues in:
  - Route handlers returning 500 errors
  - Database queries (possibly Drizzle ORM issues)
  - Data not being persisted correctly between operations

## API Server
- Startup: ✅ Success
- Health check: ✅ Responding
  - Response: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-14T17:52:04.723Z"}`
- Port: 3000
- Server framework: Fastify
- Logging: Pino with pino-pretty

## Issues Found

### 1. CRITICAL: better-sqlite3 Build Script Blocked
**Priority: HIGH (RESOLVED)**
- **Issue**: pnpm blocked build scripts by default
- **Impact**: better-sqlite3 not compiled, breaking all E2E tests
- **Resolution**: Manually ran npm run install in better-sqlite3 package directory
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Binary compiled for Linux x86-64
- **Verification**: Binary exists and is correct type

### 2. CRITICAL: E2E Test Failures (10/41 tests)
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Issue**: Multiple E2E tests failing with 500 errors
- **Symptom**: "no such column: matches.division_id" despite correct schema
- **Possible Causes**:
  1. Drizzle ORM query generation issues
  2. Database connection/transaction issues
  3. Application code bugs in route handlers
  4. Test data setup issues
- **Status**: ❌ NEEDS INVESTIGATION
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Add debug logging to identify exact query causing "no such column" error
  - Review route handler error handling
  - Check if Drizzle ORM is correctly mapping schema

### 3. WARNING: Missing pino-pretty Dependency
**Priority: MEDIUM (RESOLVED)**
- **Issue**: Server failed to start due to missing pino-pretty
- **Resolution**: Added pino-pretty as dev dependency
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Investigate E2E Test Failures**
   - Add debug logging to route handlers
   - Check actual error messages from 500 responses
   - Verify Drizzle ORM query generation
   - Review "no such column" error in context

2. **Update package.json**
   - Add pino-pretty to API package dependencies
   - Consider documenting the better-sqlite3 build issue for future deployments

3. **Document better-sqlite3 Setup**
   - Create setup guide for Ubuntu/Linux environments
   - Document the manual build step if needed
   - Consider adding a postinstall script

### Nice to Have:

4. **Improve Test Isolation**
   - Consider using separate test database per test file
   - Add better cleanup between tests
   - Add transaction rollback support for tests

5. **Add Integration Test Logging**
   - Log actual error responses in test failures
   - Add request/response debugging

## Production Readiness Checklist

**Infrastructure Requirements:**
- [✅] Node.js v20.x.x installed
- [✅] pnpm v8.x.x+ installed
- [✅] Ubuntu/Linux environment
- [✅] Build tools for native modules

**Application Status:**
- [✅] All files transferred correctly
- [✅] Dependencies installed successfully
- [⚠️] better-sqlite3 compiled (requires manual step)
- [✅] TypeScript builds: 0 errors
- [✅] Linting: 0 errors (32 warnings acceptable)
- [✅] Unit tests: 225/225 passing (100%)
- [⚠️] E2E tests: 31/41 passing (75.6%)
- [✅] Golden fixtures: 8/8 passing (26 tests)
- [✅] Database schema correct
- [✅] API server can start
- [✅] Health endpoint responds

**Blockers:**
- [❌] 10 E2E tests failing - needs investigation before production deployment
- [❌] "no such column" error suggests data layer issues

## Next Steps

### Before Production Deployment:

1. **Fix E2E Test Failures** (BLOCKING)
   - Debug the 10 failing E2E tests
   - Identify root cause of "no such column: matches.division_id" error
   - Fix application bugs causing 500 errors
   - Achieve 100% E2E test pass rate

2. **Verify Fixes**
   - Re-run full test suite
   - Perform manual API testing
   - Test all critical user flows

3. **Document Setup Process**
   - Create deployment guide for Ubuntu
   - Document better-sqlite3 build workaround
   - Add troubleshooting section

### After Achieving 100% Test Pass Rate:

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Load test API endpoints
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Check database performance

5. **Security Review**
   - Review .env configuration
   - Check file permissions
   - Audit dependencies

## Conclusion

**Status**: ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL PASS**

The Ubuntu server environment is **mostly configured correctly** with the following key points:

### ✅ Successes:
1. **Major Breakthrough**: better-sqlite3 now works on Linux (this was the Windows blocker!)
2. Core infrastructure is solid (Node.js, pnpm, build system)
3. Unit tests: 100% passing (225/225) - core logic is sound
4. TypeScript builds cleanly with 0 errors
5. API server starts and health checks pass
6. Database schema is correct

### ⚠️ Concerns:
1. **10 E2E tests failing (24.4% failure rate)** - this is a blocker for production
2. Application bugs causing 500 errors in route handlers
3. Mysterious "no such column" error despite correct schema

### 🚀 Recommendation:
**DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION YET**

The environment transfer to Ubuntu successfully resolved the better-sqlite3 compilation issue that blocked testing on Windows. However, the E2E test failures reveal application-level bugs that must be fixed before production deployment.

**Estimated Time to Production Ready**: 4-8 hours
- Debug E2E failures: 2-4 hours
- Fix application bugs: 2-3 hours
- Re-test and verify: 1 hour

The good news is that the core tournament logic (225 unit tests) is solid, and the infrastructure is working. The issues are in the API layer and can be debugged and fixed now that we have a working test environment.
